For the life of me I have tried to come up with a new nickname for Seung-Hwan Oh, I can't think of anything good 
Stunning work from #SeungHwanOh @galleryelenash @LondonArtFair from his ¡®Impermanence¡¯ series #AllMatterWillDecay
@Twins awesome #PARK!!!
Any day the @Twins get better is a good day! #Park
Byung Ho Park. What a guy. Favorite player on the entire very successful Twins Roster
Byung Ho #Park's another moon shot (Korean call)
Byung Ho Park's monster home run on Korean play-by-play. Very cool!  
Seung-hwan Oh has emerged as 1  of the most reliable pitchers in this bullpen. 
Good to see Seung Hwan Oh pitch two scoreless today in the 7th and 8th for the Cardinals.  The Korean is effective. 
Seung Hwan Oh really impressing in his "rookie" season. Has not allowed a hit
Congratulations to Seung Hwan Oh on his first career Major League win! 
This. Is. Perfect.
I didn't understand a single word, but it still was awesome!!
Little nervous watching the @Twins on TV today. Hopefully the game is closer than it was last night. #cmontwins #sundayfunday #park #sa
#hyunsookim will surly be booed running down carpet during opening day if he's on the roster #orioles #openingday
The fact that #HyunSooKim has a clause in his contract that says he can refuse being re-signed to the minor leagues is complete horseshit.

#HyunSooKim still hitless (0 for 21), @Orioles winless (0-9) 
@SteveDavisBmore isn't too worried about #HyunSooKim's start for the #Orioles during spring training...yet.
