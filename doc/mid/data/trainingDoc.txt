#Machado is off to a hot start! Do you think he'll be an #AllStar? #MLB #Orioles http://fb.me/5nT5Zf7PC
Manny #Machado is a freak of nature dude.. Guy just makes plays that no one else would dream of! #Orioles #PlatinumGlove #MannyBeingManny
Hey #Birdland, let's just use this as an excuse to bask in the glory that #Machado is our third baseman
Machado needs to be signed for 20 years. #Machado #Orioles
#Fantasy Recommendation by Brett Talley :Manny #Machado ... http://bit.ly/1SYcmDH  #Alarm
#Machado is just so damn good.

# ORIOLES!!!! 3 homers in 1 inning!!! #Machado #Reimold #Scoop! O-mazing!
#Machado with the HR, giving me a boost in the fantasy ranks! #Os #Orioles #draftkings and #Jimenez with those Ks
Manny just bein himself #Machado #Orioles
#Park goes yard for @Twins to bring them within 2 of @Brewers, down 5-3. Interesting thing is the fan almost fell out of the deck! @MLB
Amazing? #Maeda #Kenta
He is also good at painting.
Kenta Maeda is proving to the @Dodgers why they made the right choice to sign him. 3-0 with a 0.36 ERA?!? #Maeda #gododgers
Dodgers win! #LADodgers #Maeda 
#Maeda was spectacular tonight! #Dodgers
I Love LA! Dodgers Win! Player of the game Maeda! Of course he pitched a gem! #Dodgers #Maeda
Wow we can possibly be witnessing the beginning of greatness... #Maeda #Dodgers https://www.instagram.com/p/BEkIbiUKtbw/
Thanks a pantload, Pedro Baez. #fantasybaseball #Maeda
#Maeda just proved he can get himself out of a pickle. Great composure.
My fantasy baseball team would have 50% more homers if pitchers' hitting stats counted. #Maeda #Bumgarner
No need for Greinke. We got ourselves a new ace. #bleedblue #RossStripling Kersh tmrw. #maeda #DodgersVsGiants
Shout out to Kenta #Maeda who maede-a homerun in his #mlb debut with the @Dodgers yesterday!
This makes me so happy #GoDodgers #maeda #ITFDB
On a serious note loved everything about the kid , mostly the emotion he displayed after an important out #Maeda #Dodgers
"ICYMI: Video: Kenta Maeda Homers in Major League Debut >> http://goo.gl/6vx84h  #Dodgers #LetsGoDodgers #Maeda "
The #sweep is #complete! #Kenta #Maeda #shines in his #MLB #debut and the #Los Angeles #Dodgers¡¦ https://www.instagram.com/p/BD5CkWyK26b/
Kenta Maeda hits a home run, pitches Dodgers to 7-0 victory over Padres http://fw.to/8OWUqyh  #Dodgers #Maeda
#sweep great start for #kentamaeda #maeda #mlbdebut lets keep it¡¦ 
Kenta Bomb Highlights Dodgers Historic Start #DodgerFam #Maeda #Dodgers #ShutoutStreak #MLB #MLBHistory #Baseball
THIS. IS. AMAZING.??
I wish every one of these Japanese fans could be to every game at #ChavezRavine. @Dodgers #Maeda 
Love Kenta's demeanor #Maeda #DodgersWin #Sweep
I love it when baseball dugouts give players the "silent treatment" after they hit a home run #Dodgers @dodgers #Maeda
@Dodgers I hope Dave Roberts didnt promise @18kentamaeda dinner for each HR cause it looks like its gonna get expensive. #LADodgers #Maeda
First MLB Appearance and got a HR #dodgers #maeda struck out first up vs #Padres @Padres
I am so going to enjoy watching this season when #Kenta #Maeda starts!! The best is yet to come @Dodgers ?? ??  #WeLoveLA #Dodgers #sweep
Dodgers with the 3 game shutout sweep ???????? Maeda with the last shutout and first homerun  #dodgers #dodgerblue #welovela #maeda
This guy made a hell of an impact on his debut #Dodgers #dodgersvspadres #maeda
Once again baseball shows that pitchers can hit home runs as well #maeda
#Maeda had a great debut and injuries aside, the #Dodgers will be a force with a better offensive that many think and a staff on the mend
Mark Trumbo is the ex-Mariner of the year so far. Having an unbelievable start to the season.
How come Mark Trumbo hasn't gotten any starts yet ?
Mark Trumbo, who has never hit better than .268 in a season, leads the AL in batting average. Carry on.
@PeteBlackburn All they need is Mark Trumbo instead of Markakis in right field!
@Much_Better_53 Mark Trumbo shud be an angel for life thats my problem
Mark Trumbo is 2 for 2 !! Way to go Mark ??  11 game hitting streak...looking good ! Lets go @Orioles
 Daniel Murphy's approach at plate carrying over following hot postseason  #MLB
@AndrewSimonMLB also both bizarre bc how tf is Mark Trumbo doing this well offensively. When does it stop.
Dee Gordon? Who's next? #DanielMurphy
Mark Trumbo. Good signing. #analysis #OriolesMagic #IBacktheBirds
Thank you Mark Trumbo
CHRIS DAVIS IS SO FAST!!!!!!  Thank gosh he hustled and got in to second.  But, once again... Mark Trumbo, professional hitter.  #Orioles
Mark Trumbo ties this game up with a double.
Daniel, Murphy, Johansson pls all of you get well soon. 
Mark Trumbo continues hitting streak 
@FtWorthFire Welcome to my life as a Mariner fan. They always get better when they leave. Mark Trumbo latest example.
@BEARD0WN_11 ah yes. Mark Trumbo lol
Mark Trumbo, singles hitter, continues
In other words, Orioles are seeing a very rare Mark Trumbo. It previously was not a new talent level, maybe it will be this year.
And THATS why I don't miss Daniel Murphy! @Mets
Daniel Murphy doesn't even dream of starting that double play. Amazing what league average middle infielders really look like #MetsTwitter
Daniel Murphy can hold my jock.
Thanks, Mike. I really liked your Daniel Murphy feature of recency
Daniel Murphy would've caught on fire if he tried to do that
Daniel Murphy in for Thomas Flynn Can he make a difference in this half!
I find it interesting how people overlook Daniel Murphy... Like the dude continues to produce... #FantasyBaseball
I freaking love Daniel Murphy... #nats
Daniel Murphy with another hit. He's pretty good
I feel like I'm suddenly over my Daniel Murphy infatuation I had during the playoffs last year.
I cry at night thinking about Daniel Murphy. I just can't get over it man.
@InMetsWeTrust and u can trust that i won't fuck up like daniel murphy did!!!
Baseball announcers are so polite. Daniel Murphy fields a ball I'm quite certain my 5 mo old could handle. Lauded for his great play.
Daniel Murphy showing the range? Nice! Easy double play once he gets there with Molina running
Daniel Murphy was a huge part of the Mets run last year but w/ the progress of their starting pitchers +neil Walker this yrs team is better
This Daniel Murphy move was so solid he's a hitting machine
Daniel Murphy is one mighty fine looking man
Daniel Murphy has been such a great pick-up 
Sick. At least Daniel Murphy is bringing all the hits. Looks like laying in bed with baseball and draft tweets is all I got
Daniel Murphy well done! #Nationals
@MeddoconlineDr Daniel Murphy was your best player
Enjoy watching how hard Daniel Murphy plays the game.
.@BrianDozier can't wait to get to the @Twins clubhouse for their postgame dance party: "It's good to be back home
Those were some awesome catches!
This is amazing?
They have such nice booty !
yeah that was amazing and great?
One of the reasons why I love baseball!
Nice video, exciting to watch.
so nice.
Touching?
it's cool that the players do that?
hes going to do better next year?
He's got a pretty good curve.
I love this guy?
thanks for your ability?
My favorite player?
Perfect plays and bgm..
God I love baseball?
Keep up the good work?
Awesome video! Great channel. I'm subbed.
Nice inside the park home runs?
Tyler Tyler Collins. Do you understand you want the fans on your side. You deserved to get booed. That should not have happened. #Tigers #Collins
Holy Cow are you kidding me right now? @tigers #Collins WOW, saying F-U to the fans and flipping them off.....good luck Pal
Way to be classy #Collins! Waving your middle finger to the crowd
That had to be the silliest way to lose a consecutive scoreless innings streak 
If you drop a fly ball, you might want to pick it up. You might not want to flip off your fans either. #TylerCollins 
the worst thing I have ever seen done at a sporting event in Detroit I have attended over 1200 games in the city
Detroit #Tigers player #TylerCollins loses one in lights, loses cool, flips off fans. Did he go too far? 
#tylercollins "fuck em all" to the Tigers fans! Time to go back to minors and stay there Tyler. #byefelicia
Keuchel is doing his job out there but the Astros offense is not doing crap 
in spaceships they won't understand and me i ain't ever gonna understand this shit! lets #gostros #houstonastros
Holy shit he hit that fucking ball up there! #houstonastros
When people were talking shit all season long and still talking shit 
I feel like a girl that can't take the hint that her boyfriends a pice of shit #HoustonAstros #istilllovethem
The #HoustonAstros are the most profitable team in baseball. That is so pathetic how teams get away with that shit
Yooooo them #houstonastros are garbage!!! Wow they better get they shit right!!
Not even the players give a shit. #houstonastros #baseball
That ball was trapped! Get your shit together @MLB replay umpires in New York. Incompetent as fuck! #Giants
This team will absolutely lose 100 games this year. #Twins Fans need to stop going to Twin games immediately. FUCK THE POHLAD'S!
Watching the Twins is like beating yourself in the head with a hammer. #Jepsen
#Jepsen is horse shit. Fuck you #Twins
Braves we're going to be abysmal in 2016. Gonzalez can't make chicken soup with chicken s**t
The #Braves are really bad at baseball.  11-4 #Braves lose again in BOS/ATL.  They're here to play the #Cubs Friday-Sunday.
#Braves lose again. Out of 20 games to start the year, they've won only 4 of then. Fall 11-4 to the #RedSox and to 4-16 on the year.
This whole it's all about live sports/content has bubble signs. The money does have to come from somewhere. #Greinke deal
#Molina is a little ole bitch! Fuck the #Birds Fuck the #Cards Fuck Molina ole fuck boy ass bitch!
King Bitch was benched? Hope he doesn't throw a tantrum #Puig
Your a fucking bitch #puig. Sit down   Go roll some cigars #STLCards #STLvsLAD #NLDS
Glad his bitch ass didn't win #espn #puig the media ballooned his head
@BestFansStLouis "@redbirdsalm: @eddiegreen82 He's a little bitch! I wish he's thugs would find him. Take him back to Cuba" #Puig
I hate that fucker! Punk bitch! #puig #fuckLA #SFGiants
If you going to talk shit at least put your name next to the quote don't be a pussy #Puig is not the worst person in baseball
That's what you fucking get, Dave Roberts for taking out Ross Stripling during his no-hitter because of "pitch count." Pussy managing. #MLBs
Yes, #TylerCollins did indeed give #DetroitTigers crowd the finger.. And mumbled "F*** everybody".
Mark Trumbo leading the AL in batting avg.. Definitely not gonna last
Mark Trumbo is killing the O's on defense. It's a slow death, but it's happening.
@LyleMSpencer @Mtrumbo44 I never have seen him hotter!! it just means when he gets into one of his slumps it will be a long one.
Daniel Murphy couldn't do that #LGM
Daniel Murphy is not making that play. Not even close. Neil Walker is much better all around and I am hype.
Daniel Murphy and Hunter Pence are both so awkward; easily the two most uncomfortable people to watch play baseball.
Daniel Murphy will surely hit a slump soon
Fuck Daniel Murphy
Daniel Murphy at this point is not hot he's actually a good player. My opinion
Pitchers see Miggy in their nightmares. You could see him at the #ASG
lol remember when MLB overhyped the shit out of the Red Sox and their offense before the 2015 season
MLB TV is trash today, holy shit. Not working on PS4 or PC.
Nice one Lee Dea Ho. But the commentator is too noisy and disgusting?
I'm confused why didn't the athletics runner score in that first inning?
Stupid fucking music ruins it?
all i can think about is his poor arm after 
At Least injuries are not deliberately done like fucking football.
oh my gosh those poor people 
Hudson injury is BRUTAL! Oh man.
Stupid sport!
That stuff would suck?
that guys is tough as hell?
Baseball is such a bitch sport. Even the injuries suck?
That was scary?
Shut the fuck up minority?
My brother was at the first injury?
Fuck Bautista...cocky prick.
Hate the Yankees so much.
Bautista murders orioles pitchers who throw at him... just ask Oday?
Fuck A-Roid the fucking cheat?
damn daniel?
Gomez a pervert I think?
Who the hell would want to meet that scumbag, Carlos Gomez??
U suck?
U suck that is true?
Fucking gay?
Horrible game :(
Shame he got injured, was really having a solid year.
sucks he¢¥s gonna miss the postseason?
Totally awesome!
choo is my favorite?
Great catch
Fuck ya Pillar, Go Jays Go
the teams are so shitty?
Goddamn Kiermaier is so underrated
God ellsburry is a terrible fielder?
I feel so bad for that old guy with the fire works?
And I thought my week was going bad?
fuck all you?
curveball is so nasty?
Haters gonna hate?
@patcarroll11 after seeing your top 4 hated teams I had a feeling you were biased against a lot of teams #BrandonPhillips #Choo #Cleveland
Kick his ass, sea bass!  #indians #royals #Hannahan #Choo
Settle down you weak little Asian man!! #jays #Indians #Choo you got nothing #MLB
Hey buddy, the ball is behind you. It's not in your glove. #Puig #Dodgers
Diet no longer the primary cause of high blood pressure. No no....its now Brian Wilson. #Dodgers  #wilson #facepalm
Why does #Mattingly insist on still using #Wilson in important situations?  Makes absolutely no sense.  #Dodgers
Chris Sale's curve was so fucking dirty omg.
This is painful to watch?
SOME PLAYERS DONT KNOW HOW TO CATCH?
FUCK YOU JIM JOYCE?
That Jerry Mills (Meals?) call is the worst call I have ever seen. Jesus christ?
I think both hits were of the infield variety, and he seemed to have trouble getting under pretty routine fly balls to LF (though he made all the plays that came his way).
I watched Kim's debut and was not impressed.
Konner Lare apparently he's an asshole?
Puig is so overrated.
Puigs basics are very bad .he will cost more games with his ego than with his knowledge of the game?
I can't stand puig or harper because they both are cocky, pompous, assholes but AT LEAST HARPER HUSTLES!
puig always has been a little bitch.
puig is so arrogant?
Puig is such an overrated player and acts like he's the best in baseball.
No wonder why every pitcher in the MLB throws at him. He's a punk bitch.
